Ticket Tracker is a single page application that helps you keep track of your concerts and live show events. It allows you to log planned tickets for future shows and record passed shows for memories and reference.

## Installation

To get started first, fork and clone this repo. Also fork and clone [the frontend rails api repo](https://github.com/mguachun/flix-fix-backend.git).

And then execute:

    $ cd concert-api-backend
    $ bundle install

To test run **rails s** in the console

    $ rails s
    => Booting Puma
    => Rails 6.0.3.2 application starting in development
    => Run `rails server --help` for more startup options
    Puma starting in single mode...
    Version 4.3.5 (ruby 2.6.1-p33), codename: Mysterious Traveller
    Min threads: 5, max threads: 5
    Environment: development
    Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3001
    Listening on tcp://[::1]:3001
    Use Ctrl-C to stop

This will run your rails api backend server.

## Usage

After starting your server use the homepage at [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to navigate through the webpage and view the backend API in json.

Next open a separate terminal the execute:

    $ cd concert-client
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

This will open up the index html file and get your development environment started.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
