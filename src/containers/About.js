       <strong>Ticket Tracker</strong> was inspired by my own concert ticket collection from childhood.
       After every show I would retrieve my tickets and a keep them in a box with other trinkets and photos
       for safe keeping. Every so often I would take the box out to go through my tickets to relive the memories
       I had from each concert. Concerts have changed quite a bit since then but tickets continue to be a momento that encapsulates
       special moments in time. The digitization of tickets and concerts all together is what ultimately 
       inspired me to bring this concept into a new age.
